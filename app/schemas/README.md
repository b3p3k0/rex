# Room Database Schemas

This directory contains Room database schema exports generated by the Room Gradle plugin.

## Policy

- **Track schemas**: All `.json` files in this directory are committed to git
- **Purpose**: Enable migration validation and schema diffing between versions
- **Generated files**: One `.json` file per database version (e.g., `dev.rex.app.data.db.RexDatabase/1.json`)

## Usage

Schema files are automatically generated during build when `exportSchema = true` is set in the `@Database` annotation.

These files should be reviewed and committed when:
- Database version is incremented
- Schema changes are made to entities
- New migrations are added

Do not manually edit these files - they are generated artifacts.
